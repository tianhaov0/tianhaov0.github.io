I am a Research Scientist in <a rel="external nofollow" href="https://ai.meta.com/research/ranking-and-recommendations/" target="_blank">Ranking AI Research (RAIR)</a> team at Meta. 

Prior to RAIR, I worked in Signals Matching - Identity Modeling team where I focused on foundation model development using Mixture-of-Experts (MoE), Multi-Task Multi-Label (MTML), and Two-Tower Sparse Network (TTSN).

I completed my PhD in Theoretical and Computational Chemistry in May 2023 from <a rel="external nofollow" href="https://www.smu.edu" target="_blank">Southern Methodist University</a>. The title of my PhD thesis is "<a rel="external nofollow" href="https://scholar.smu.edu/hum_sci_chemistry_etds/34/" target="_blank">Exploring Protein Conformations and Functions Through Molecular Dynamics Simulations and Machine Learning</a>". 


I received a Master of Science degree in Computer Science (<a rel="external nofollow" href="https://omscs.gatech.edu" target="_blank">OMSCS</a>) at Georgia Tech in 2022.
