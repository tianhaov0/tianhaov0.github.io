  abstract={Allostery refers to the biological process by which an effector modulator binds to a protein at a site distant from the active site, known as allosteric site. Identifying allosteric sites is essential for discovering allosteric process and is considered a critical factor in allosteric drug development. To facilitate related research, we developed PASSer (Protein Allosteric Sites Server) at https://passer.smu.edu, a web application for fast and accurate allosteric site prediction and visualization. The website hosts three trained and published machine learning models: (i) an ensemble learning model with extreme gradient boosting and graph convolutional neural network, (ii) an automated machine learning model with AutoGluon and (iii) a learning-to-rank model with LambdaMART. PASSer accepts protein entries directly from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) or user-uploaded PDB files, and can conduct predictions within seconds. The results are presented in an interactive window that displays protein and pockets’ structures, as well as a table that summarizes predictions of the top three pockets with the highest probabilities/scores. To date, PASSer has been visited over 49 000 times in over 70 countries and has executed over 6 200 jobs.},

  abstract={The absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADMET) properties are important in drug discovery as they define efficacy and safety. In this work, we applied an ensemble of features, including fingerprints and descriptors, and a tree-based machine learning model, extreme gradient boosting, for accurate ADMET prediction. Our model performs well in the Therapeutics Data Commons ADMET benchmark group. For 22 tasks, our model is ranked first in 18 tasks and top 3 in 21 tasks. The trained machine learning models are integrated in ADMETboost, a web server that is publicly available at https://ai-druglab.smu.edu/admet.},

  abstract={Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation is widely used to study protein conformations and dynamics. However, conventional simulation suffers from being trapped in some local energy minima that are hard to escape. Thus, most of the computational time is spent sampling in the already visited regions. This leads to an inefficient sampling process and further hinders the exploration of protein movements in affordable simulation time. The advancement of deep learning provides new opportunities for protein sampling. Variational autoencoders are a class of deep learning models to learn a low-dimensional representation (referred to as the latent space) that can capture the key features of the input data. Based on this characteristic, we proposed a new adaptive sampling method, latent space-assisted adaptive sampling for protein trajectories (LAST), to accelerate the exploration of protein conformational space. This method comprises cycles of (i) variational autoencoder training, (ii) seed structure selection on the latent space, and (iii) conformational sampling through additional MD simulations. The proposed approach is validated through the sampling of four structures of two protein systems: two metastable states of Escherichia coli adenosine kinase (ADK) and two native states of Vivid (VVD). In all four conformations, seed structures were shown to lie on the boundary of conformation distributions. Moreover, large conformational changes were observed in a shorter simulation time when compared with structural dissimilarity sampling (SDS) and conventional MD (cMD) simulations in both systems. In metastable ADK simulations, LAST explored two transition paths toward two stable states, while SDS explored only one and cMD neither. In VVD light state simulations, LAST was three times faster than cMD simulation with a similar conformational space. Overall, LAST is comparable to SDS and is a promising tool in adaptive sampling. The LAST method is publicly available at https://github.com/smu-tao-group/LAST to facilitate related research.},

  abstract={Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have been actively used in the study of protein structure and function. However, extensive sampling in the protein conformational space requires large computational resources and takes a prohibitive amount of time. In this study, we demonstrated that variational autoencoders (VAEs), a type of deep learning model, can be employed to explore the conformational space of a protein through MD simulations. VAEs are shown to be superior to autoencoders (AEs) through a benchmark study, with low deviation between the training and decoded conformations. Moreover, we show that the learned latent space in the VAE can be used to generate unsampled protein conformations. Additional simulations starting from these generated conformations accelerated the sampling process and explored hidden spaces in the conformational landscape.},

  abstract={Allostery is considered important in regulating protein's activity. Drug development depends on the understanding of allosteric mechanisms, especially the identification of allosteric sites, which is a prerequisite in drug discovery and design. Many computational methods have been developed for allosteric site prediction using pocket features and protein dynamics. Here, we present an ensemble learning method, consisting of eXtreme gradient boosting and graph convolutional neural network, to predict allosteric sites. Our model can learn physical properties and topology without any prior information, and shows good performance under multiple indicators. Prediction results showed that 84.9% of allosteric pockets in the test set appeared in the top 3 positions. The PASSer: Protein Allosteric Sites Server (https://passer. smu. edu), along with a command line interface (https://github. com/smutaogroup/passerCLI) provide insights for further analysis in drug discovery.},
